It’s a bit difficult for me to answer this question, as I’ve only been part of the team for three months. However, I hope that I’ve been able to contribute to the projects I’ve worked on, such as TIN/DOT, Tire Sidewall and License Plate.
Through these tasks, I’ve learned a lot about how to approach real-world challenges in machine learning and text recognition, and I’ve aimed to apply that knowledge to help move these projects forward. While my contributions might have been small compared to the team’s overall efforts, I hope they’ve helped in building solutions that align with the team’s and organization’s goals.

From the very beginning of my internship, I faced the challenge of having to quickly learn and apply a large amount of new information, tools, and practices. This wasn’t always easy, and there were times when I struggled to adapt as quickly as I wanted, which may have had an impact on the team’s deadlines.
To overcome these difficulties, I focused on staying organized and prioritizing tasks. I asked questions whenever I needed clarification and sought feedback from my teammates to ensure I was on the right track. Breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps also helped me stay focused and make consistent progress.
Looking back, I believe I could have managed my time and workload more effectively during the initial stages of my internship. I sometimes hesitated to ask for help early on, wanting to figure things out on my own, which slowed me down.
Overall, these experiences taught me how to handle uncertainty and adapt more quickly to new challenges, which is something I will carry forward as I continue to grow in my career.

During the first three months of my internship as an engineering intern, I learned and grew a lot in different areas:
1.	Testing and Development Practices: I got hands-on experience with writing unit tests and learned how to use Test-Driven Development (TDD). This helped me write better and more reliable code while also understanding how to approach tasks more systematically.
2.	Machine Learning and Computer Vision: I worked with tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch for image classification projects. I built a custom CNN model for binary classification and used pretrained models for multi-class classification. These projects gave me real-world experience and helped me connect what I had learned before to actual tasks.
3.	Project Management and Teamwork: I started using tools like Jira and Confluence and saw how they are used to organize and track work in a team. By being part of daily team activities, I also got to see how Agile Methodology works in practice and how it helps teams stay on track and focused.
Aside from all the technical skills I gained, I also grew a lot on a personal level. I learned how important it is to stay curious and not be afraid to try new things, even if they don’t work out right away. Making mistakes and learning from them was a big part of the process for me. I also realized that looking at problems from a different angle can often help find a solution, even when things seem tough.
These experiences not only helped me complete my tasks but also taught me how to approach challenges with an open mind and a positive attitude, which I think is just as important as technical skills.

In the next reporting period – until the end of my internship – I would like to keep growing in this field to get a more complete understanding of how IT products are developed and managed throughout their lifecycle. Overall, I hope to build a stronger foundation that will not only help me during my internship but also prepare me for future opportunities in this field.

Over the past three months, I’ve demonstrated ownership by approaching all my tasks with focus and responsibility. I’ve made an effort to be proactive in learning, adapting to challenges, and ensuring my contributions support the team’s goals.

My professional goals for the next year are to continue learning and growing in this field and related areas. I want to expand my knowledge, improve my technical skills, and gain more hands-on experience with real-world projects. Additionally, I aim to develop a better understanding of team workflows and contribute to the success of the projects I’m involved in.

I’d like to express my gratitude for the support and patience I’ve received throughout this period. It has made a big difference in helping me learn.
